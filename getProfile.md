# WikiTree API: getProfile
## Parameters
|Param|Value|
|-----|-----|
|action|getProfile|
|key|WikiTree ID or PageId|
|fields|Optional: comma-separated list of fields to return|
|bioFormat|Optional: "wiki", "html", or "both"|
|resolveRedirect|Optional: If 1, then requested profiles that are redirections are followed to the final profile|

### key
The "key" parameter is used to indicate which profile to return. This can be either a "WikiTree ID" or a "Page ID". The WikiTree ID is the name used after "/wiki" in the URL of the page. For example, for [Person Profile Pages](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Person_Profile) like https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Shoshone-1, the WikiTree ID is "Shonshone-1". For [Free-Space Profile Pages](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Help:Free-Space_Profile), the "Space:" prefix is required. For example, for https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Space:Space:Edward_D._Whitten%27s_Model_Ships, the WikiTree ID is "Space:Edward_D._Whitten%27s_Model_Ships". 

### fields
The "fields" parameter is optional. If left out, a default set of fields is returned. For Person profile pages, the default is all fields other than the biography, children and spouses. For Free-Space profile pages, the default is to return all fields.

You can specify which fields to return by setting the "fields" parameter to a comma-separated list of those you want. You can also use "*" to indicate "all fields". 

### bioFormat
If you request the "bio" field (the text biography for a Person profile), the default is to return the content as it's stored, with wiki markup. You can instead request that this markup be rendered into HTML (as it would appear on the profile's web page) by specifying a "bioFormat" of "html". If you use a bioFormat value of "both", then both the original wiki text and the rendered HTML will be returned.

### resolveRedirect
Generally if you start at a valid profile and follow use the ids associated with relationships (mother, father) you should get a valid/complete profile in return. However, in some circumstances you may end up requesting a profile that has been merged away into another profile, or otherwise is redirected. If you set resolveRedirect=1 in your POST to the API, then any profiles that would be returned that are redirections will be followed to their end point, and *that* final profile will be returned.

The following fields are derived from other fields. They can be requested with "Derived.FieldName".

The relative fields are arrays of Profile items, indexed by Id, each with the same fields as for the returned profile.
|Field|Description|
|-----|-----------|
|Parents|

|Siblings|

You can also request **Managers** or **TrustedList**. Either one returns an array of profile data that includes Id, Page Id, and Name for the person on the list. For TrustedList, the list is all people on the Trusted List of the profile and each entry includes an "IsManager" field, set to 1 if the person is a manager and zero otherwise. For Managers, only those that are managers are included.

You can request **Categories**. The returned field is an array of the Category titles which are connected to the profile.

You can request **Templates**. This returns an array with the set of templates in use on a profile. Each element in the array contains the "name" of the template, as well as an array of "params" to hold the options/parameters of that template. The "params" array is a set of key/value pairs. If the option/parameter in the template was just a single value, then that is the "key" and the value is null. For example:

```
{{9-11 Sticker}}
      "Templates": [
        {
          "name": "9-11 Sticker",
          "params": [
            
          ]
        }
      ],

        {
          "name": "1776 Sticker",
          "params": {
            "unit": "Founding Father",
            "image": "Thornton-1863-4.jpg"
          }
        },
      ],

{{FindAGrave|121976543}}
      "Templates": [
        {
          "name": "FindAGrave",
          "params": {
